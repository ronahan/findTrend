# Expanding Horizontal Accordion in React

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/nevernotsean/pen/YpmWoM](https://codepen.io/nevernotsean/pen/YpmWoM).

A quick alternative to the standard 'Accordion' pattern, built completely with React.

This was my first jump into ReactJS, so any feedback is welcome.
